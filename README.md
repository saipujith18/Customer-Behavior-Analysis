## Introduction
Customer Behavior Analysis involves examining how customers interact with a business, product, or service. This analysis helps organizations tailor their strategies and improve customer experiences in a competitive market.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the **Ecommerce Customer Data**, which includes information on customer interactions such as purchase history, browsing time, and demographic details.

## Analysis Process
The analysis follows a structured process:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data related to customer interactions.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and address data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
3. **Statistical Summary**: Calculate basic statistics to summarize the data.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to explore trends, patterns, and anomalies.
5. **Clustering**: Use techniques to group customers based on common behaviors or characteristics.

## Key Findings

- **Gender Distribution**: Analysis of customer gender representation.
- **Browsing Behavior**: Relationship between product browsing time and total pages viewed.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segmentation based on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
- **Churn Rate**: Calculation of customer churn rate indicating retention issues.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations, such as:
- Histograms for age distribution.
- Bar charts for gender distribution.
- Scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables.
- Funnel charts for conversion analysis.
